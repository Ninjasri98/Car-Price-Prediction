Car Price Prediction using Linear and Lasso Regression Models

This project predicts car prices based on features such as mileage, engine size, and age using Linear and Lasso Regression models for used cars. The models were trained on a dataset to provide accurate price estimates while minimizing overfitting. The Linear Regression Model had a R Squared Error of 0.87 on training data and 0.83 on test data while the Lasso Regression Model had a R Squared Error of 0.84 on training data and 0.87 on test data
